# Two Sum in Sorted Array using Two Pointers - C

## Description  
This program finds two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a given target using the **two-pointer technique**.  

## How It Works  
1. The user inputs the number of elements in the array.  
2. The user inputs the elements **in ascending order**.  
3. The user enters the target sum.  
4. The program uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to efficiently find a pair that sums to the target.  

## Example Run  
<p>Enter the no of element in the array: 5</p>
<p>Enter the elements in ascending order: 1 2 3 4 6</p>
<p>Enter the target no: 7</p>
Output: 
3 + 4 = 7
